Welcome to Puppy&#39;s personal blog"<b>PPLOG</b> is a tiny Perl script, a wonderful personal blog. Use as a diary for your own use, or publish on the web -- my blog at <a href=http://puppylinux.com/blog/ target=_blank>http://puppylinux.com/blog/</a> is an example.<br /><br />The default admin password for Puppy&#39;s Personal Blog is &#39;woofwoof&#39; -- edit /root/Web-Server/blog/pup_pplog.pl to change that, as well as other blog settings.<br /><br />The author of PPLOG is &#39;Fedekun&#39; and the home page is:<br /><a href=http://pplog.infogami.com/ target=_blank>http://pplog.infogami.com/</a><br /><br />The webserver being used to serve PPLOG is <b>Hiawatha</b> and I am impressed. Hiawatha is small, with many features and was very easy to get going. It has SSL support and URL-rewriting, plus lots more. The author guarantees it to be secure! Here is the home page:<br /><a href=http://hiawatha.leisink.org/ target=_blank>http://hiawatha.leisink.org/</a><br /><br />Puppy has local documentation on Hiawatha here (note: actual location is /root/Web-Server/hiawatha.htm):<br /><a href=http://127.0.0.1/hiawatha.htm target=_blank>http://127.0.0.1/hiawatha.htm</a><br /><br />Have fun!"17 Jul 2009, 20:37"General"00000
